# Identifying Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions
Fraudulent credit card transactions refer to unauthorized or illegal charges made using someone else's credit card information. These transactions typically occur when criminals steal credit card details through various methods, such as phishing, data breaches, or card skimming, and then use the stolen information to make purchases or withdraw funds. Fraudulent activity can result in financial losses for both the cardholder and the financial institutions involved. Detecting and preventing fraud often involves advanced techniques like machine learning models, real-time transaction monitoring, and multi-layered security systems. The goal is to identify suspicious behavior patterns that indicate fraud and minimize the risk of unauthorized transactions.
